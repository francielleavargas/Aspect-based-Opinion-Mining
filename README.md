#Semantic resource for aspect-based sentiment analysis and text summarization applications in Portuguese.

In this path, we are providing three fine-grained taxonomies for aspect-based sentiment analysis and text summarization applications. The Aspect ontologies - groups of (hierarchically organized) explicit and implicit fine-grained opinions - including the smartphones, digital cameras, and books domains. The provided taxonomies are available in OWL format.
