<h2 align="center"> TaxinoPro - Taxonomies for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis </h2>  

We provided three fine-grained taxonomies for aspect-based sentiment analysis and text summarization applications in Portuguese. The taxonomies of aspect (hierarchically organized) contain explicit and implicit aspects (also known as fine-grained opinions) from user consumer reviews related to <b>smartphones</b>, <b>digital cameras</b>, and <b>books</b>. The taxonomies are available in <b>OWL format</b>.
